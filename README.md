# SpecflowArgus
This project is based on .Net Core + specflow. I have used specflow integration with specflow runner.

All the methods are present in billCalculatorCommonFunctions.cs file.
Since this is a testing project I have used the assertions to compare the actual output with the expected output in the step definition file.
